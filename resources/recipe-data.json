            "Name": "Homemade Sausage Rolls",
            "Description": "\"The secret is the bacon...\" It really takes this sausage roll to another level! Also, sautéing the onion and celery before mixing into the filling makes it sweet and more moist than the usual. The addition of fennel adds an extra burst of flavour (optional) - pork and fennel are great mates - and using panko instead of normal breadcrumbs also contributes to making the filling of this sausage roll so moist.",
            "Filling": [
                "1/2 tbsp olive oil", 
                "2 cloves garlic , minced",

                "1 celery stalk , finely chopped",
                "5 oz / 150g bacon , finely minced (streaky and fatty, not the lean stuff!)",
                "2 tsp fennel seeds , toasted (optional) (Note 1)",
                "1 lb / 500g pork mince (ground pork) (not lean)",
                "3/4 cup / 40g panko breadcrumbs (Note 2)",
                "1 egg",
                "1/2 tsp salt",

            ],
            "Instrucions": [
                "Heat oil in a non stick fry pan over medium high heat. Sauté garlic, onion & celery for 2 minutes, then add bacon.",
                "Cook for a further 2 minutes (don't make bacon golden) then transfer to bowl and allow to cool for 10 minutes.",
                "Add remaining Filling ingredients into the bowl. Use your hands to mix well.",
                "Lay out a rectangle of pastry, long edge closest to you. Brush egg along one long edge.",
                "Get 1/5 th of the filling and shape into a long log shape down the middle of the pastry. Ensure the meat is tight and compact, without gaps.",
                "Brush edge of pastry with egg. Then roll up, finishing with the seam side down.\nRoll up, sealing on the edge with egg wash on it .",
                "If you have time/patience, refrigerate for 1 hour (makes it easier/neater to cut)"

                "Place on 2 baking trays lined with baking paper (or sprayed with oil). Bake for 30 - 35 minutes in total, swapping tray shelves at 20 minutes, or until the pastry is deep golden brown. (Note: The filling will still look pink because of the bacon, but it's easy to tell from texture that it's cooked)",
